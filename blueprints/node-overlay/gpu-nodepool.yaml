# NodePool for GPU instances with slicing support
# This NodePool allows both p (performance) and g (graphics) instance categories
# which include various GPU instance types.
# It references the gpu-bottlerocket EC2NodeClass which uses Bottlerocket AMI
# with pre-configured NVIDIA device plugin.
#
# NOTE: With time-slicing enabled (4 replicas per GPU), each physical GPU
# is advertised as 4 nvidia.com/gpu resources. The limit below accounts for this.
